% Bibtex bibliographic data base using the canonical set given in the
%   ASCE web document "Instructions For Preparation Of Electronic Manuscripts"
% For use with the ascelike.bst bibliographic style file.
%
% A few 'fine points' about bibtex data bases:
%   1) Entries that are NOT enclosed in quotations marks ("" "") 
%      must contain data.  For example, the NUMBER entry.  If you don't
%      know the NUMBER, don't leave it blank.  Just remove the entire 
%      NUMBER line.
%   2) Bibtex will suppress capital letters within the TITLE of an article
%      (except for the first word of the title).  To force capitalization, 
%      enclose the capitalized letter(s) in curly braces, such as {ASCE}
%      of {SI}.
%   3) Although unusual, if the reference has no author, you will need to
%      be somewhat creative to produce ASCE-like output.  This usually occurs
%      when the "non-author" is an organization instead of a person, but
%      it also applies to newspaper articles.  Try the following:
%        a) if the non-author is a a single word or abreviation ("ASTM" or
%           "Newsweek"), try formatting as a book, incollection, or article,
%           placing the non-author in the AUTHOR field.
%        b) if the non-author is multiple word (Federal Highway 
%           Administration), you will need to be creative, since bibtex
%           will confuse the non-author as a person with first, middle, and
%           last names (for example, Federal, H. A.).  Try using the MANUAL
%           format as shown in FHWA:1991a, FR:1968a, and ICBO:1988a
